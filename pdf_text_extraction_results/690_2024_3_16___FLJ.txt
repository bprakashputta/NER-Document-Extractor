MALINZAK, Plaintiff, v. WEST PENN POWER, Defendant, v. ITRON, INC., Additional Defendant. : : : : : : : No. 2110 of 2019, G.D. : Honorable Linda R. Cordaro OPINION AND ORDER Linda R. Cordaro, J. February 12, 2024 Currently before this Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Additional Defendant Itron {1} and a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant West Penn Power. After consideration of the pleadings, briefs, and oral arguments presented by the parties, both motions are denied for the reasons set forth below. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Complaint was filed on September 27, 2019. According to the Complaint, on or about November 15, 2018, Defendant West Penn Power ("Defendant") installed a new power meter on a mobile home owned by Plaintiff. The Complaint then alleged that on or about January 10, 2019, the power meter malfunctioned, causing the mobile home to lose power. As a result of the loss of pmver, the water pipes froze and burst, flooding the mobile home. The Complaint raised one claim in negligence against De- fendant for failure to properly install and maintain a functioning meter and for failing to notice there was a sudden reduction in power usage. The Complaint requested relief in an amount less than $50,000 plus interest and costs of suit, and demanded arbitration. On March 2, 2020, Defendant filed a Complaint to Join Additional Defendant Itron ("Additional Defendant"), the supplier of the power meter. The Complaint to Join raised claims of negligence and contractual indemnity. Discovery was undertaken, {2} and on July 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion for jury trial, averring that further investigation had revealed damages in excess of $50,000. That motion was granted on July 15, 2022. _______________________ {1}This is Additional Defendant's second motion for summary judgment. The first was filed on August 19, 2022 and scheduled for presentation during motions court on September 9, 2022. Counsel for Additional Defendant then filed for a continuance believing that the time for presen- tation of the motion was when oral argument was scheduled. On September 21, 2022, judicial staff informed counsel for Additional Defendant that the motion for summary judgment had not been properly filed under local rule F.C.R. 1035.2(a), and therefore, oral argument had not been scheduled. Counsel indicated she would re-file the motion but did not do so. On November 23, 2022, the motion was denied, without prejudice, for failure to comply with the local rule. FAYETTE LEGAL JOURNAL XXI Plaintiff filed several motions to compel against Defendant between May 31, 2022 and July 28, 2022. This Court scheduled a hearing on those motions for September 9, 2022. Defendant's counsel did not appear, and, accordingly, Plaintiffs motions were granted. Defendant's counsel subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration on October 4, 2022 on the grounds that a clerical error in his office caused him to be unaware of the date and time of the hearing. Reconsideration was granted, an evidentiary hearing was held on December 2, 2022, and this Court issued an amended order on December 5, 2022. Defendant also had filed its own motion to compel responses against Plaintiff on November 30, 2022, and the matter was referred to discovery mediation on December 5, 2022. This Court scheduled a pre-trial conference for October 27, 2023, which was con- tinued to December 11, 2023 on Additional Defendant's uncontested motion. On Octo- ber 31, 2023, Additional Defendant filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. This Court then scheduled oral argument on the Motion to be held at the date and time originally set for the pre-trial conference and directing that the conference would be rescheduled upon disposition of the Motion. Defendant subsequently filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on November 30, 2023 but did not comply with local rule F.C.R. 1035.2(a). To allow sufficient time for all parties to respond, on December 5, 2023, this Court issued an order establishing a briefing schedule, setting oral argument on Defendant's Motion to be held January 17, 2024, and sua sponte re-scheduling oral argument on Additional Defendant's Motion for same January date and time. Counsel for a11 parties appeared on January 17, 2024 and presented oral arguments. DISCUSSION Any party may move for summary judgment after the relevant pleadings are closed when: 1) there is no genuine issue of any material fact as to a necessary element of the cause of action or defense which could be established by additional discovery, or 2) if, after relevant discovery is complete, an adverse party who will bear the burden of proof at trial has failed to produce evidence of facts essential to the cause of action or defense that in a jury trial would require the issues be submitted to a jury. Pa.R.Civ.P. 1035.2. "Summary judgment may be granted only where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Belden & Blake Corp. v. Com., Dep't of Conservation & Nat. Res., 969 A.2d 528,531 (Pa. 2009). The court views the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, resolving all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact against the moving party. Id. Additional Defendant's Motion challenges that (1) Plaintiff does not have standing because the property in question is owned by the Dale Malinzak Trust, not Plaintiff; and (2) there is no evidence that Additional Defendant caused failure or damage. Defend- ant's Motion raises the sole issue of standing an the same grounds as Additional Defend- ant's Motion. _______________________ {2} As stated above, the Complaint in this matter was filed on September 27, 2019, and Defend- ant's Complaint to Join was filed on March 2, 2020. As late as October 18, 2023, Additional De- fendant filed notice of service of its first request for admissions and second set of interrogatories directed to Plaintiff. The discovery period in this case therefore has far exceeded the time limit set by F.C.R. 212.1 (240 days from the filing of the complaint except by court order for good cause shown). XXII FAYETTE LEGAL JOURNAL As to Plaintiffs lack of standing, both Additional Defendant and Defendant present- ed copies of Fayette County tax records showing that the Trust is listed as owner of the property. However, Plaintiff provided an affidavit attesting that the owner of the mobile home is the individual, Dale Malinzak. Plaintiffs explanation is that the land is owned by the Trust but that the mobile home itself, which is the subject of the action, is owned by the individual Dale Malinzak. The affidavit further attests that rental income earned from the mobile home is reported on Plaintiffs individual tax returns, any taxes are paid from his personal bank account, the homeowner's insurance policy on the home was issued to him, and that the Trust does not own any mobile homes. A party must have direct interest in the matter being litigated, the interest must be immediate and pecuniary, and it must be substantial (that is, there must be some dis- cernible adverse effect); a person that is not adversely affected in any way has no stand- ing to obtain judicial resolution. Wm. Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 346 A.2d 269, 280-81 (Pa. 1975). Additional Defendant cited to Witt v. Common- wealth, Dep't of Banking in its Motion, pointing out that a party has standing if it has been aggrieved by another and so has cause to recover damages, but a party that has suffered no losses or damages lacks standing. 425 A.2d 374,377 n.7 (Pa. 1981). Here, there still remains a question as to whether the mobile home is owned by Plaintiff or the Trust since the issue has not been sufficiently established. However, re- gardless, Plaintiff attested to his direct interest in the mobile home, including that his income includes rent earned from the home and that he holds the policy for the home- owner's insurance. Because Plaintiffs interest was affected by damage caused to the mobile home, he has standing to attempt to recover for those damages. The issue of standing therefore is denied as to both Motions. As to Additional Defendant's contention that there is no evidence of causation at- tributable to it, the element of causation is normally a question of fact for a jury to deter- mine and may be removed from a jury's consideration only if it is clear that reasonable minds could not differ on the issue. Hamil v. Bashline, 392 A.2d 1280, 1285 (Pa. 1978). Here, discovery indicates that power was shut off either by: (1) direct signal sent via a physical connection (potentially attributable to Defendant); (2) remote signal (potentially attributable to Additional Defendant); (3) a malfunction of the meter itself (potentially attributable to Defendant, Additional Defendant, or both). The question of causation remains unresolved and reasonable minds could differ on the issue, which precludes a grant of summary judgment in Additional Defendant's favor. Therefore, the Court enters the following: ORDER AND NOW, this 12th of February, 2024, after consideration of Additional Defend- ant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, as well as the pleadings, briefs, and oral argument of the parties, it is hereby ORDERED and DIRECTED that the Motions are DENIED.
