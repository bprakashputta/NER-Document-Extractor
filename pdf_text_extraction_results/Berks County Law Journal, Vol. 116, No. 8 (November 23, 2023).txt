Orphans' Court – Termination of Parental Rights – Best Interests Summary: Berks County Children and Youth Services petitioned to terminate the parental rights of the Mother from her Child as a result of mental health concerns, inadequate housing and income, inappropriate physical discipline, inappropriate supervision, inability to meet child’s medical and educational needs, and lack of appropriate parenting skills. Based on the testimony and evidence presented, the Court found that the termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child. IN THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF BERKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA ORPHANS' COURT DIVISION NO. 88453 In Re: M.J.R., Jr. MEMORANDUM OPINION PATRICK T. BARRETT, J. NOV. 3, 2023 This matter came before the Court on the separate petition of Berks County Children and Youth Services (“BCCYS” or “the Agency”) to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of C.D.R.-M. a/k/a C.M. a/k/a C.R.-M. a/k/a C.R. (“Mother”) from her child M.J.R., Jr. (“Child”) (born 4/13/16), pursuant to Sections 2511(a)(1), (2), (5), and (8) of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2101 et seq. (the “Act”). The Final Decree determination is based on this Court’s finding that several grounds for termination were established at the trial under 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 2511. Specifically, the Agency filed for termination under 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 2511(a) (1),(2), (5), and (8) with the following concerns that led to Child’s placement originally: mental health concerns; inadequate housing and income; inappropriate physical discipline; inappropriate supervision; inability to meet Child’s medical and educational needs; and lack of appropriate parenting skills. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On January 20, 2023, BCCYS filed separate Petitions for Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights relative to Mother and Father. A hearing on the Petition against Father and unknown John Doe was held on May 22, 2023. After hearing held, Father and unknown John Doe’s rights were terminated by Order dated May 22, 2023. An Amended Petition for Termination of Parental Rights relative to Mother was filed on June 12, 2023. A pretrial hearing on Mother’s Petition was held on June 12, 2023. Trial on Mother’s Petition was held over three days: July 17, 2023; August 21, 2023; and September 5, 2023. This Court heard BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 54 Vol. 116 testimony from fourteen witnesses: six BCCYS witnesses and eight witnesses for Mother over the course of three days during this trial. A. Finding of Dependency FINDINGS OF FACT The instant case came to the attention of BCCYS in January 2018. Previously, Mother had a history with CYS in Northampton County and Lehigh County. On May 10, 2019, a Petition for Dependency was filed, alleging Child was without proper care or control, subsistence, education, or other care necessary.1 By Order dated May 29, 2019, the Honorable Judge J. Benjamin Nevius found that the Agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that Child is a Dependent Child due to domestic violence issues, lack of parenting skills, lack of parental supervision, inappropriate physical discipline, and lack of cooperation with the Agency.2 Legal custody was to remain with Mother and Step-Father at that time. A regularly scheduled permanency review hearing was held on October 17, 2019, which found Mother was moderately compliant with the permanency plan.3 On December 12, 2019, Child was found no longer dependent.4 On July 27, 2020, a new dependency petition was filed, alleging Child was without proper care or control, subsistence, education, or other care necessary.5 By Order dated August 26, 2020, the Honorable Judge J. Benjamin Nevius found that the Agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that Child is a Dependent Child due to domestic violence issues, lack of parenting skills, lack of parental supervision, and inappropriate physical discipline.6 Legal custody was to remain with Mother at that time.7 On September 4, 2020, a referral was made to BCCYS regarding child abuse against E.R., the older sibling of Child.8 The investigation was completed on October 1, 2020, wherein Mother was found to be the perpetrator of mental abuse against E.R.9 On October 12, 2021, BCCYS filed a Motion for Review of the Dispositional Order.10 This review was requested due to issues with housing, truancy, and Mother’s lack of cooperation with the agency.11 At that time, the Agency asked for Child to be placed in foster care.12 On October 28, 2021, after a hearing 1 Exhibit 1. 2 Exhibit 3. 3 Exhibit 4. 4 Exhibit 5. 5 Exhibit 6. 6 Exhibit 7. 7 Id. 8 Exhibit 8. 9 Id. 10 Exhibit 12. 11 Id. 12 Id. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. Vol. 116 55 was held before the Honorable J. Benjamin Nevius, the Agency was awarded temporary physical custody of the child based upon findings of abuse, neglect, or dependency of Child and that it was in the best interest of Child to be removed from Mother’s home.13 Permanency review hearings were held on December 9, 2021; January 1, 2022; and July 20, 2022.14 In December 2021, Mother had made no progress towards alleviating the circumstances which necessitated the original placement but was minimally compliant with the permanency plan.15 In January 2022, Mother had made no progress towards alleviating the circumstances, which necessitated the original placement, but was minimally compliant with the permanency plan.16 In July 2022, Mother had made minimal progress towards alleviating the circumstances, which necessitated the original placement, and was moderately compliant with the permanency plan.17 On August 3, 2022, after BCCYS received reports that Mother had made attempts to contact Child through professional providers, therapists, and childcare service providers, the Honorable J. Benjamin Nevius issued an order that contact between Mother and Child shall only occur during supervised visitation at the frequency and level of supervision ordered by the Court.18 On November 3, 2022, after Child had been in placement for 12 months, BCCYS filed a Motion to Suspend Visitation based on a report BCCYS received that Mother told Child she would bring a knife to the next visit and kill him.19 Additionally, BCCYS received another report that during a therapy session with Andrea Karlunas from FenixCare Counseling, that Child reported that Mother said to him that she was going to kill him in front of his therapist.20 It was noted during visits that Child was extremely anxious and stated on multiple occasions that he does not want to attend visits with Mother.21 A hearing on this Motion to Suspend Visitation was scheduled before the Honorable J. Benjamin Nevius for November 28, 2022.22 After hearing held, the Honorable J. Benjamin Nevius suspended Mother’s Visitation by order dated December 6, 2022.23 Mother appealed this ruling to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s order suspending visitation on June 12, 2023.24 A permanency review hearing was held in January 2023, which found 13 Exhibit 13. 14 Exhibits 14-16. 15 Exhibit 14. 16 Exhibit 15. 17 Exhibit 16. 18 Exhibit 56. 19 Exhibit 18. 20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Exhibit 19. 23 Exhibit 20. 24 Exhibit 54. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 56 Vol. 116 Mother had made minimal progress towards alleviating the circumstances which necessitated the original placement and was moderately compliant with the permanency plan.25 In June 2023, a permanency review hearing was held in which Court found Mother had made no progress towards alleviating the circumstances, which necessitated the original placement, and was minimally compliant with the permanency plan.26 B. Progress of Mother The first BCCYS witness was adoption caseworker Rebecca Mill. Ms. Mill testified to her work on the case and the history of the case. A dependency petition was filed for this Child in 2019 for issues with lack of supervision, domestic violence, and physical discipline. In July 2020 another dependency petition was filed. As a result of the second petition, Child remained in the home with Mother, and Mother was required to do services: parenting education, psych treatment, maintain housing and income, casework services, and sign releases. In October 2021, BCCYS filed a petition for review due to issues with housing, truancy, and Mother’s lack of cooperation with BCCYS. At that time, Mother was staying at Water Street Mission in Lancaster, Child was not enrolled in school, and Mother was not cooperating with BCCYS. As a result, BCCYS asked for legal custody of Child, and legal custody was transferred to BCCYS. Mother had scheduled visits with Child until October 2022, when her visits were suspended by Judge Nevius. In April 2023, BCCYS received a referral, which Ms. Mill investigated. The alleged perpetrator was Mother, and the victim was Child. In June 2023, Mother was indicated as a child abuse perpetrator. Ms. Mill was aware that Mother has housing since the placement and stated Mother does not work but does receive SSI. Ms. Mill also testified that the items Mother was told to work on were not remedied: Mother has not remedied her own mental health; Mother does not show that the child is the first priority; and Mother has refused to be reevaluated for a mental health evaluation. Ms. Mill additionally described Mother as being difficult to work with on case work issues. This included testimony that during casework sessions, Mother would become argumentative and would not take any responsibility. Additionally, if Ms. Mill would describe how Child perceives something, Mother would deny it happened at all to take the focus off herself as the problem. In April 2023, Ms. Mill investigated a report of abuse of Child, in which Mother was named as the perpetrator.27 A licensed psychologist, Isabella Evans, evaluated Child on May 24, 2023 and determined that Child suffered serious mental injury as a result of Mother’s actions.28 As such, Mother was indicated as a child abuser.29 25 Exhibit 21. 26 Exhibit 55. 27 Exhibit 51. 28 Id. See also, Exhibit 52. 29 Exhibit 51. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. Vol. 116 57 Ms. Mill also testified that after the Court ordered Mother was to have no contact with Child, in April 2023, Mother attempted to contact Child by sending cupcakes to his school for his birthday. Ms. Mill testified that after this incident, Child’s behavior changed, he was unsettled most of the time and had trouble self- regulating. Later in April 2023, while the Court order was still in place, Mother again attempted contact with Child, this time while participating in a doctor’s visit via phone. While on the doctor’s visit call, Mother spoke to Child directly. Child expressed to Ms. Mill that he was fearful of Mother after this doctor’s appointment. Andrea Karlunas testified next. She is a licensed clinical social worker with FenixCare Counseling Services.30 She was qualified as an expert in trauma therapy during this trial. Ms. Karlunas was working with Child to provide trauma therapy from March 2022 until July 2023. At the beginning of her counseling with Child, his behaviors were elopement, inability to recover from intense emotions, and inability to regulate behaviors in school and at home. During a session, Child verbalized that Mother told him not to talk to therapist. Ms. Karlunas testified that presented as a barrier to Child’s treatment. Eventually, Child would talk to Ms. Karlunas regarding what would happen at home with Mother. Before visits were stopped with Mother, Child told Karlunas that Mother liked to hold him to get the “angries out” and that he did not like that. Child further confided in Karlunas that the police were called to a visit with Mother when Mother whispered to him that she would kill him with a knife. Ms. Karlunas testified that, in her opinion, Mother is an object of terror for Child and that Mother would have to do a lot of work to create a safe place for Child. Currently, Child does not feel safe, and despite a Court order, Mother continues to have contact with Child. As such, Child fears that Mother will come take him one day, and he will not be safe. Ms. Karlunas testified that in October 2022, Mother came to the office when Child was scheduled for therapy. Mother was observed with another party parked across from the office. Mother exited the vehicle and placed a red duffle bag in front of the vehicle. As a result, the facility was locked down, and Child was taken into an office until Mother left. Based on this interaction, Child’s therapy sessions were moved to another location. Ms. Karlunas further testified that Child’s therapy progress was going well until April 2023. With the two incidents with Mother contacting Child through cupcakes at school and the doctor’s visit, Child does not feel safe. As Child continues to be retraumatized and cannot resolve his trauma triggers while Mother continues to be in his life, Ms. Karlunas has discontinued trauma therapy and instead recommended placement in therapy to move away from trauma basis and allow Child to begin healing current triggers and coping with those. Ms. Karlunas stated that, in her opinion, it would take years of therapy to resolve and eliminating Mother’s interactions with him would help the source of his triggers 30 Exhibit 57. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 58 Vol. 116 and what is causing his mental distress. Next, Dr. Isabella Evans testified. Dr. Evans was qualified at trial as an expert in forensic psychology.31 Dr. Evans received a referral from BCCYS for serious mental injury evaluation. Her evaluation into this required a clinical interview with Child and Foster Parent and psychological testing that is appropriate based on age. This evaluation was done on May 24, 2023, and Dr. Evans recommendations were completed on June 8, 2023.32 Dr. Evans testified that during his initial assessment, Child presented as hyperactive, anxious, talkative, and had moderate self-awareness. Child discussed in his evaluation being hit over and over again, being beaten by a belt and shoe, and how Mother would call him stupid or dumb. Additionally, Child described an incident where his brother was locked in a freezer and could not get out. Child also described his frequent nightmares and says he dreams about his Mother physically and emotionally abusing him. As a result of this evaluation, Dr. Evans determined that Child suffered a severe mental injury from Mother and recommended therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for Child. Dr. Maria Ruiza Yee, a board-certified psychiatrist with a focus on adult care, testified next.33 She was qualified as an expert in adult psychiatry. Mother was referred to her for a psychological evaluation, which was done on November 10, 2020, and a report was issued.34 Dr. Yee opined that Mother is “deceitful in her interaction with BCCYS. She has this perspective that she is always being taken advantage of and because of this, she utilizes the legal system to obtain redress from her perceived victimization. She is quite manipulative and is street savvy in utilizing whatever resources are available to her. She has no qualms in being deceitful either. She is irresponsible and rationalizes her irresponsibly towards the care of her children.”35 Further, Dr. Yee testified that Mother “regards her children as objects to be used in whatever ends she wants,” “she does not care for the children,” and “she just uses them for financial gain or as weapons against her paramours.”36 As a result of this evaluation, Dr. Yee opined that Mother is not fit to be a parent to her children, and if she is allowed custody of the children, they will suffer the same abuse and trauma that she has subjected her oldest child to.37 Most strikingly, Dr. Yee testified that, in her opinion, “no amount of treatment or classes will make a difference as to the characterologic deficiencies that Mother has imbedded in her. Mother has no insight into her pathology and instead, insists that nothing is wrong with her. The first ingredient in an effective outcome of treatment is the recognition that something is wrong and that this needs to be 31 See Exhibit 60, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Isabella Evans. 32 See Exhibit 52. 33 See Exhibit 59, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Maria Ruiza Yee. 34 Exhibit 28. 35 Exhibit 28, p. 14. 36 Id. 37 Id. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. Vol. 116 59 corrected and there must be a willingness to do so.”38 Mother possesses none of these factors. Next, Gerald Menaquale testified. Mr. Menaquale is the Clinical Director of the Commonwealth Clinical Group in Lancaster, PA.39 The Commonwealth Clinical Group does adult alternative to violence evaluation. One of Mr. Menaquale’s employees prepared, and Mr. Menaquale reviewed, the evaluation done on Mother dated March 1, 2022.40 Commonwealth Clinical Group felt that Mother needed domestic violence treatment due to her paramours and how she treated her children. The final witness for BCCYS was the initial caseworker assigned to this case, Sarah Hottenstein. Ms. Hottenstein was assigned to this case in April 2020 while Child was living with Mother and three siblings. There were a multitude of concerns at that time, including physical discipline in the home; Child not attending eye doctor checkups or wearing his glasses; the older sibling, also a minor, was supervising the younger children; and concerns with Mother not participating with spot checks with BCCYS. Ms. Hottenstein described one incident of Mother leaving the children alone with only the oldest brother there in early May 2020. Specifically, she detailed how the oldest child had called her, he was upset, and explained that he was left alone with the three younger children. Ms. Hottenstein went to the house for a check, and Mother was not there. When she arrived, she heard Mother yelling through the Alexa in the living room telling the oldest child she was upset. Additionally, upon her arrival to the house, the oldest child shared a recording of Mother calling the oldest child and telling him he was a pig and she would murder him. Once Mother arrived back home, Ms. Hottenstein talked to her about the concerns of leaving the younger children with the oldest. Mother did not answer questions but eventually admitted she messed up and deliberately left the children with the oldest child again. During that visit, Ms. Hottenstein observed an injury on Child’s lip. She asked Mother what happened, and Mother gave a story about a small accident in the bathroom where she accidently kicked Child in the face. Child told Ms. Hottenstein a different story of what happened. In 2021, Ms. Hottenstein assisted with getting Child placed into foster care after Mother suddenly moved out of the county and into Lancaster County without notifying BCCYS while she was between a hotel or a friend’s house. Mother eventually landed at Water Street Mission in Lancaster. Due to Mother’s noncompliance with case work at Water Street, Mother was evicted. BCCYS eventually tracked the children down as being at TLC in Lancaster, although Mother again did not notify BCCYS she was moving locations. During her time on this case, Ms. Hottenstein described Mother as difficult to work with. There were issues with Child regularly attending school. Initially, 38 Id. 39 See Exhibit 58, Curriculum Vitae of Gerald A. Menaquale, Jr. 40 Exhibit 26. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 60 Vol. 116 Mother wanted to homeschool Child, so he was never enrolled until October 2021. Mother would not sign releases during the duration of the case, but if she did sign any, she would alter them to limit the information to release or give an expiration date on them. Mother presented eight witnesses in her defense to not terminate parental rights. Specifically, Mother presented the following witnesses: S.B., a friend through church; Pastor David Torres-Oyola, the pastor at Rohrerstown Church that counseled Mother; S.R., another friend through church; J.E., a family friend; S.R., Mother’s sister and Child’s maternal aunt; Milagros Paulino and Sandra Mendez, mental health therapists at Spanish American Civic Association who saw Mother; and finally, Mother testified on her own behalf. S.B. testified that she has known Mother for one and half to two years and that they met at church. She sees Mother every week. S.B. claims that even after being presented with the allegations of emotional abuse, S.B. believes Mother is still a good person. However, S.B. never saw Mother interact with any of Mother’s children. As such, this Court puts little weight into her testimony. Next, Pastor David Torres-Oyola testified. He is the pastor for Rohrerstown Church. He did spiritual counseling with Mother. Beyond seeing Mother as a spiritual counselor, Pastor Torres-Oyola had little to testify to that would contradict the Agency’s testimony. The next witness Mother called was S.R.. She is a teacher for Manheim Township and met Mother at a church event in Summer 2021. The three youngest children were with Mother when S.R. met her. S.R. testified that she observed Mother interact with her children often, and she did not see any concerns with how Mother interacted with the children. Additionally, she testified that she is a mandated reporter. She taught the children alone in bible/Sunday school and did not see anything concerning that she felt would have needed to be reported. Next Mother called J.E. to testify. J.E. is a family friend and has seen Mother with the children many times. J.E. testified that she considered the children spoiled and told Mother to be stronger with them and to discipline them more. She testified regarding the fact that Mother does not have her two older daughters anymore after Mother was in jail after she stabbed her boyfriend with a knife.41 Significantly, J.E. has issues seeing, and this Court is not convinced that J.E. is a credible witness. Mother’s next witness was her sister, S.R.. S.R. testified she has seen Mother with the children and described her as a great mother. However, she also testified that she never saw Mother discipline her children and had talked to Mother about the lack of discipline. S.R. also testified she saw the ex-boyfriend get physical with Mother two to three times. He would hit Mother, and they would have a screaming match. S.R. also testified that their mother suffered from schizophrenia, and there was one incident growing up with their mother. After the incident, both Mother and S.R. were placed in foster care. On cross, S.R. testified that she 41 The criminal court documents were also presented at Exhibit 29. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. Vol. 116 61 witnessed Mother tell the oldest child she was going to kill him, but S.R. claimed it was not a real threat. Additionally, during S.R.’s testimony, it was observed that she was referencing notes while on the stand. These notes were reviewed by BCCYS and the guardian ad litem, and while concerning, there was no objection to her testimony given while the notes were in front of her. After discovery, the notes were no longer allowed to be referenced during her testimony. Next, Mother called Milagros Paulino to testify. Ms. Paulino was Mother’s mental health therapist at the Spanish American Civic Association (“SACA”). Mother attended sessions with Ms. Paulino once a week for approximately one and a half years.42 Ms. Paulino did write letters to BCCYS on Mother’s progress.43 Significantly, these letters were little more than boilerplate letters that stated that Mother was being seen by SACA and the dates of when. There was nothing to note of what they were treating or how. Additionally, during the testimony, Ms. Paulino claimed she was working with Mother on goals of “empowerment and self-esteem.” These goals were claimed by Ms. Paulino to help with Mother’s diagnosed anxiety and depression because when she started acting positive, the anxiety would diminish. This Court puts little weight into Ms. Paulino’s testimony and instead finds Dr. Yee’s testimony and report credible. Ms. Sandra Mendez was called as a witness next. Ms. Mendez was Mother’s second therapist from SACA. Ms. Mendez saw Mother from September 2022 until December 2022. Ms. Mendez also wrote update letters to BCCYS.44 Again, these update letters were bareboned and contained little to no information. Unlike Ms. Paulino, Ms. Mendez at least set Mother’s goals in therapy to overcome trauma and to adjust her to not having her children. However, Ms. Mendez testified that while at the beginning she was seeing Mother weekly, those visits went down to every other week because of financial support. Additionally, as Ms. Mendez was only working with Mother for approximately 3 months, this Court puts little weight into Ms. Mendez’s testimony. Finally, Mother testified on her own behalf. She did comply with domestic violence counseling.45 She was seeing different therapists at SACA. Mother completed two nurturing parenting classes. Additionally, since the case was opened, she now has a 3-bedroom home. When Mother had Child, she moved frequently, causing instability in Child’s housing. Despite Mother’s numerous witnesses, it is imperative to note that not a single one of her witnesses was able to provide credible testimony that undermined the evidence put forth by BCCYS in favor of terminating Mother’s parental rights. 42 On cross and based on a letter written in March 2022, the time she was seeing Mother was more accurately described as seven months. 43 See Exhibit 43. 44 Exhibits 43 and 61. 45 See completion certificate at Exhibit 62. BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 62 Vol. 116 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW The law is well settled that “[t]erminating the parental rights of the natural parent to his [or her] child carries with it a constitutional significance because of the importance of the rights involved.” T.J.B. v. E.C., 652 A.2d 936, 943 (Pa. Super. 1995) (citing In re: J.W., 578 A.2d 952, 957 (Pa. Super. 1990)). “Consequently, clear and convincing evidence is necessary to prove the statutory grounds necessary to terminate parental rights.” Id. In termination cases, the burden remains upon the Agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that its asserted grounds for seeking termination are valid. In re: J.L.C., 837 A.2d 1247, 1251 (Pa. Super. 2003). The standard of clear and convincing evidence is defined as: testimony that is so “clear, direct, weighty and convincing as to enable the trier of fact to come to a clear conviction, without hesitance, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.” In re: Adoption of Atencio, 650 A.2d 1064, 1066 (Pa. 1994). A trial court must examine the individual circumstances of each case and consider all explanations offered by the parent to determine if the evidence in light of the totality of the circumstances clearly warrants termination. J.L.C., supra. When considering whether to terminate parental rights on the ground that the parent failed to perform parental duties for at least six months prior to the termination petition, a court should consider the entire background of the case and not simply mechanically apply the six-month statutory provision; the court must examine the individual circumstances of each case and consider all explanations offered by the parent facing termination of his parental rights, to determine if the evidence, in light of the totality of the circumstances, clearly warrants the involuntary termination. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(1); see also In re: Z.P., 2010 PA Super 56, 994 A.2d 1108 (2010). Additionally, “[t]he Orphans’ Court is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence presented and is likewise free to make all credibility determinations and resolve conflicts in the evidence.” In re: M.G., 855 A.2d 68, 73-74 (Pa. Super. 2004). The Court applies a two-part test when determining whether parental rights should be terminated. In re: L.M., 923 A.2d 505, 511 (Pa. Super. 2007). Specifically, the L.M. Court stated as follows: Initially, the focus is on the conduct of the parent. The party seeking termination must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parent’s conduct satisfies the statutory grounds for termination delineated in Section 2511(a). Only if the court determines that the parent’s conduct warrants termination of his or her parental rights does the court engage in the second part of the analysis pursuant to Section 2511(b): determination of the needs and welfare of the child under the standard of best interests of the child. One major aspect of the needs and welfare analysis concerns the nature and status of the emotional bond between parent and child, with close attention paid to the effect on the child of permanently severing any such bond. Id. (internal citations omitted). BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. Vol. 116 63 Upon appellate review, the following standard shall be applied: [W]e repeat that appellate courts must apply an abuse of discretion standard when considering a trial court’s determination of a petition for termination of parental rights. As in dependency cases, our standard of review requires an appellate court to accept the findings of fact and credibility determinations of the trial court if they are supported by the record. If the factual findings are supported, appellate courts review to determine if the trial court made an error of law or abused its discretion. As has been often stated, an abuse of discretion does not result merely because the reviewing court might have reached a different conclusion. Instead, a decision may be reversed for an abuse of discretion only upon demonstration of manifest unreasonableness, partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will. In re: Adoption of S.P., 47 A.3d 817, 826 (Pa. 2012) (citations omitted). Statutory Claims and the Best Interest of the Child BCCYS proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that the rights of Mother should be terminated under 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2511(a)(1), (2), (5), and (8). This Court also finds that termination of her parental rights is in the best interest of Child. The language at subsection 2511(a)(1) provides that parental rights in regard to a child may be terminated on the grounds that a “parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child or has refused or failed to perform parental duties.” Subsection (a)(2) provides that parental rights may be terminated on the grounds that “[t]he repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal of the parent has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being and the conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.” Paragraph (a)(5) provides for termination of parental rights when a “child has been removed from the care of the parent by the court or under a voluntary agreement with an agency for a period of at least six months, the conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child continue to exist, the parent cannot or will not remedy those conditions within a reasonable period of time, the services or assistance reasonably available to the parent are not likely to remedy the conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child within a reasonable period of time and termination of the parental rights would best serve the needs and welfare of the child.” Finally, subsection (a)(8) provides that parental rights may be terminated on the grounds that “[t]he child has been removed from the care of the parent by the court or under a voluntary agreement with an agency, twelve months or more have elapsed from the date of removal or placement, the conditions which led to the BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 64 Vol. 116 removal or placement of the child continue to exist and termination of parental rights would best serve the needs and welfare of the child.” Section 2511 further provides that, “[w]ith respect to any petition filed pursuant to (a)(1), (6), or (8), the Trial Court shall not consider any efforts by the parent to remedy the conditions described therein which are first initiated subsequent to the giving of notice of the filing of the petition.” 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(b). Importantly, “parental rights may not be preserved by waiting for some more suitable financial circumstance or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities.” In re: D.J.S., 737 A.2d 23, 287 (Pa. Super. 1999). The long-standing law of the Commonwealth is that the inability of the parent(s) to perform parental duties makes him or her just as parentally unfit as a parent who refuses to perform these duties. In re: B.L.W., 843 A.2d 380, 388 (Pa. Super. 2004). Regardless of inability or refusal, once a parent demonstrates a failure to fulfill his or her parental duties,46 the child’s right to fulfillment of his or her potential in a permanent, healthy, safe environment with proper parenting supersedes the parent’s basic constitutional right to custody and rearing of the child. Id. When terminating the parental rights of any parent, the trial court must give “primary consideration to the developmental, physical, and emotional needs and welfare of the [c]hildren.” 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(b). This Court can appreciate that Mother appears to care for Child. That said, given numerous opportunities, Mother has not shown that she has the ability – or desire – to remedy the conditions which led to the removal of Child in the first place. This Court seriously questions whether Mother can ever fully appreciate the needs of Child. With regard to Mother, this Court acknowledges that Mother loves her child and wants to care for him; however, this Court cannot ignore her extensive mental health issues, including inflicting mental abuse on her children, as well as the fact that Mother was still attempting to become comfortable with basic child-rearing, particularly with this being one of Mother’s six (6) children. Mother’s mental health and inappropriate parenting, coupled with her ongoing toxic relationships with men, clearly mitigates in favor of termination. This Court fully credits the testimony of Andrea Karlunas, Dr. Evans, Dr. Yee, and the psychiatric reports for their conclusion that the denial of termination would pose a further risk to the health and well-being of Child. Aside from the myriad of other facts that have been discussed above warranting termination, Mother’s refusal (or complete inability) to identify any parental skill that she has gained from this process is disturbing. This Court also considered the numerous witnesses Mother presented in 46 There is no simple or easy definition of parental duties. Parental duty is best understood in relation to the needs of a child. A child needs love, protection, guidance, and support. These needs, physical and emotional, cannot be met by a merely passive interest in the development of the child. Thus, our courts have held that that the parental obligation is a positive duty which requires affirmative performance. In re: Adoption of A.C., 162 A.3d 1123, 1129 (Pa. Super. 2017). BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. Vol. 116 65 favor of not terminating.47 However, none of the witnesses presented negated the overwhelming clear and convincing evidence presented by BCCYS in favor of terminating. Specifically, none of Mother’s witnesses showed Mother was fit to parent this Child and that it was in Child’s best interest for Mother’s parental rights to not be terminated. This Court considered all the testimony and finds that Mother clearly does not have the ability to provide a loving and stable home for this Child and has not remedied any of the conditions that led to the initial placement. Although this Court recognizes that the Agency only needs to establish one of the statutory factors in order for the Court to terminate parental rights,48 this Court finds that the evidence overwhelmingly establishes all of the elements of each of the relevant subsections in 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511. Further, the evidence shows that while Mother loves Child, that is not enough to overcome other evidence presented in this case. What is in the best interest of this Child is outweighed by what little evidence was presented regarding the bond between Mother and Child. Moreover, this Court finds that the evidence clearly establishes that Child is well-bonded with Foster Parents, and his interests are best served by terminating Mother’s parental rights and opening Child up for adoption. CONCLUSION Based on the aforementioned historical review and analysis, this Court finds that BCCYS has met their burden under Section 2511 of Title 23. This Court further finds that the best interests of Child are served through the TERMINATION of Mother’s parental rights. FINAL DECREE AND NOW, this 3rd day of November, 2023, after hearing, this Court finds that the facts alleged in the Petition for Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights have been established by clear and convincing evidence, and that all parental rights and duties of C.D.R.-M. a/k/a C.M. a/k/a C.R.-M. a/k/a C.R., biological mother, are therefore terminated forever as to the above-named child. Custody of the child is placed with Berks County Children and Youth Services, which is authorized to give consent to or proceed with adoption of the child, which may be decreed without further consent of or notice to the said parent. This determination is based on this Court’s finding that several grounds for termination were established at the hearing under 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 2511. In particular, the Court finds the agency established by clear and convincing evidence grounds for termination under 23 Pa. C.S.A. 2511(a)(1),(2), and (5). Although the testimony at trial showed that Mother loved this child, this Court agrees that is not enough to overcome what is best for this child. This Court further finds very little parent 47 “[Q]uantity does not equal quality when a child’s best interests and permanency are at stake.” Int. of D.D-E.L., 253 A.3d 281 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2021). 48 See In re J.E., 745 A.2d 1250 (Pa. Super. 2000). BERKS COUNTY LAW JOURNALIn Re: M.J.R., Jr. 66 Vol. 116 child bond, pursuant to 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 2511(b), between Mother and Child. Mother has not visited with Child since October 2022. Further, a strong bond has been established between Child and Foster Parents. In accordance with 23 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 2921-2926, said parent is advised of the continuing right to place and update personal and medical history information, whether or not the medical condition is in existence or discoverable at this time, on file with the Court and with the Department of Human Services.
